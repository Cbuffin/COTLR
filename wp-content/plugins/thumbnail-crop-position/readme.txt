Select the crop position of your thumbnails.

== Description ==

Select the crop position of your thumbnails. Wordpress crops thumbnails of images through the center, which does not always give us the desired results. This plugin allows you to select the crop position of images from Wordpress uploader. You can select one of the nine coordinates of the image and thumbnails of the image will be cropped from the selected coordinate. This plugin works properly with plugins to regenerate images. For example, to regenerate with the plugin Simple Image Sizes, which is what I usually use, thumbnails of a previously uploaded image you have to follow the next steps:

1. Go to Media > Add New and select the thumbnail crop position.
2. Go to Media > Library and and go to the Edit Media screen of the image you want to regenerate.
3. Press Regenerate Thumbnails button.

Most plugins to regenerate thumbnails have the option to regenerate a single image. You have to select the coordinate from where you want to crop the image and afterwards regenerate it.


== Installation ==

1. Install Thumbnail Crop Position either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. That's it. You're ready to go! You will find Thumbnail Crop Position panel in Upload files tab of Insert Media panel and in Upload Media page of Media.
